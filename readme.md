# Introduction 
This repository contains my builds of various suckless software. 

## Installation
After cloning, you can install each program by jumping to its directory and issuing ```make```.
To install dwm for instance, you would do:
```git clone https://github.com/dyf-bits/dyf-suckless.git
cd dyf-suckless/dwm
sudo make clean install
```

## Notes
- Each program has a readme that describes the build as well as the patches applied.
- You might want to modify ```config.h``` for each program before building.
