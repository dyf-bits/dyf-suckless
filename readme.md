# Introduction 
This repository contains my builds of various suckless software. 

## Installation
Clone the repository with:
```git clone https://github.com/dyf-bits/dyf-suckless.git```

Then you can install each program like so:

```

## Notes
- Each program has a readme that describes the build as well as the patches applied.
- You might want to modify ```config.h``` for each program before building.
